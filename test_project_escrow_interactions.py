"""Phase 3: interaction matrix and adversarial paths.

These tests cross mechanisms that each have their own tests: settlement with
appeal credit and bonds, outflows in QUEUED / EMITTED / BOUNCED, late
payments, CLOSED, refund and finalization, the error callback, and the
ordering of permissionless calls.

Every value-bearing step asserts the full accounting identity:

  funded + credit_received + unmatched_returns
    == locked + credit_held + bond_held + queued + inflight + bounced
       + unmatched_held + sent
