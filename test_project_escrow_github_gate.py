"""Phase 4: the GitHub check gate.

The gate is objective and runs before any model call. It is always resolved
against the exact commit the evidence is pinned to, and the observed runs are
hashed into consensus so validators agree on what was seen, not merely on the
verdict.

Rules it must never break: a missing, pending, rate-limited or unreachable
answer is UNAVAILABLE and burns no revision; only a completed failing run is
a rejection; a green run on another commit or under another name can never
stand in for the required one.
