"""Windows compatibility for gltest Direct Mode stdin injection.

gltest 0.29.2 injects the message context by writing it to a temp file,
duplicating that file onto fd 0, and then immediately unlinking it
(`gltest/direct/loader.py::_inject_message_to_fd0`). POSIX allows unlinking a
file that is still open; Windows does not, so every deploy raises

    PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file
    because it is being used by another process

and no Direct Mode test reaches its contract assertions.

Why this module replaces the function instead of wrapping it
------------------------------------------------------------
The first version of this shim called gltest's own function and intercepted
`os.unlink` for the duration. That was wrong. `_inject_message_to_fd0` does
`import os` *inside the function body*, so there is no module-level
`loader.os` attribute to wrap locally; interception had to replace
`os.unlink` on the global `os` module, which affects the WHOLE PROCESS for
that window, including unrelated threads. A lock would not fix it either:
other code does not take our lock.

Local interception of that unlink is therefore impossible, so this module
installs its own injector. It mirrors gltest 0.29.2's logic exactly, except
that the temp file is not unlinked while fd 0 still holds it open. Nothing
global is patched: no `os` function is replaced and no other file deletion
anywhere in the process is affected.

The cost of mirroring is drift. `UPSTREAM_SOURCE_SHA256` pins the upstream
source this copy was written against, `verify_upstream_unchanged()` reports a
mismatch, and a test fails loudly on a gltest upgrade so the copy is
re-synced deliberately rather than silently diverging.

When the temp file is deleted
-----------------------------
After gltest restores stdin in `VMContext._cleanup_after_deactivate`
(`dup2(original, 0)` then `close`), which is registered as an `ExitStack`
callback and so runs even when a test fails. That is the first moment the
file is genuinely closed. Anything still undeletable is retried once at the
end of the session and, if it survives that, reported by path as a warning.
A leftover is surfaced, never hidden, and `PermissionError` is never simply
swallowed.

Set ESCROW_FORCE_WINDOWS_STDIN_COMPAT=1 to exercise this path on a
non-Windows machine. That is for testing the shim itself; it is not used in
normal Linux or CI runs, which remain authoritative.
