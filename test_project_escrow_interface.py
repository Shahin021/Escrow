"""Phase 4: the versioned read interface.

These views are what other tooling codes against, so their shapes are frozen
under the interface id. Amounts are decimal strings, because probe L1 showed
a JS consumer receives a Number for small integers and a string for large
ones.

Scope note: probe L8 verified one-way emitted write messages between
contracts. A synchronous cross-contract view read is NOT verified, so these
tests exercise the interface directly, and the limitation is recorded in the
docs rather than implied away here.
