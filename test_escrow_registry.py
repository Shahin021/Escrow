"""Phase 4: the escrow registry, exercised through real inter-contract calls.

gltest Direct Mode does not execute inter-contract operations at all
(_CROSS_CONTRACT_OPS is excluded from its mock), so these tests use glsim's
SimEngine, which ships with genlayer-test and implements the PostMessage
queue. The emitted call is really enqueued and drained, and the receiver sees
the CALLING CONTRACT as sender, which is what the registry authenticates on.

No installed package is patched and nothing pretends delivery works.
